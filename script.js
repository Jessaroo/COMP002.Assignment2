// For each of the 10 tasks below, write a console.log(...) statement that satisfies the
// requirement. Write your code to accomplish the programming task beneath each comment.

// 1. Write code to output the following string to the console:
// "Hello World!"
let variable1 = "Hello World!";
console.log(variable1);

// 2. Write code to concatenate three strings and output the result to the console:
// "Hello", " ", "World!"
let variable2 = "Hello" + " " + "World!";
console.log(variable2);

// 3. Write code to output "Hello" on one line and "World!" on the next line to the console.
// *Note: You should only have one console.log() statement - how do you add a new line in
// a string?...
let variable3 = "Hello";
console.log(variable3);
variable3 = "World!";
console.log(variable3);

// 4. Write code to output the result of the arithmetic expression to the console:
// 3 * 8 + 2;
let variable4 = 3 * 8 + 2;
console.log(variable4);

// 5. Write code to output the result of the comparison:
// 5 is less than 10.
let variable5 = 5 < 10;
console.log(variable5);

// 6. Write code to output the result of the comparison:
// 10 is greater than 5.
let variable6 = 10 > 5;
console.log(variable6);

// 7. Write code to output the result of the comparison:
// "Apples" is NOT equal to "Oranges"
let variable7 = "apples" != "oranges";
console.log(variable7);

// 8. Write code to output the result of the comparison:
// 10 * 10 is greater than 50 AND 5 * 5 is less than 50
let variable8 = 10 * 10 > 50 && 5 * 5 < 50;
console.log(variable8);

// 9. Write code to output the result of the comparison:
// 1 + 2 is greater than 5 OR 1 * 10 is greater than 5
let variable9 = 1 + 2 > 5 || 1 * 10 > 5;
console.log(variable9);

// 10. Write code that demonstrates an automatic type conversion as shown in Chapter 01.
let variable10 =10;
console.log(variable10);
variable10 = "15";
console.log(variable10);
